# kitchen ordering system

This project is actually intended to built as a project for Database system practice.
Development is going to be continued as a little project for me (lol).

## notes

Made by using Visual Studio 2017, integrated to Microsoft SQL Server 2017.
You need to import the SQL file by yourself into SQL Server, and also add some
login data into the database.

The SQL file has been included. You can take a look of it too.

## progress

Currently in progress for any finishing.
Partially finished, needs more fixes and revision in the database.

Changes applied on programs: some SQL strings (due to lost of SQL database)
